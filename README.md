# DASR
We propose a novel infrared SR model, named DASR, which incorporates a Transformer with spatial and channel dual-attention mechanisms. In DASR, spatial attention captures both local and global information through window-based and cross-window contextual long-range interactions, while channel attention captures channel-wise global information through cross-channel interactions. With this new Transformer architecture, our method effectively extracts spatial and channel global information, which cannot be captured by the local receptive field of convolution, thus making it more suitable for infrared SR.
